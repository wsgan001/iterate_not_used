#### Installation Instructions





 	
  1. Upload the ‘easy-footnotes’ folder to the ‘/wp-content/plugins/’ directory.

 	
  2. 通过WordPress的的“Plugins”菜单激活插件

 	
  3. That’s it! Now simply start using the [note]Footnote content goes here.[/note] shortcode within your posts.




#### How do I insert a footnote into my post.


Simply use the shortcode [note]Footnote content goes here[/note] and Easy Footnotes will enter numeric footnotes into your post that open on hover and take the user to the footnote at the bottom of the page on click.


#### That’s awesome!


I know, but that’s not really a question.


#### Oh right, why is that so awesome?


Because it’s easy. And it’s integrated with the qTip2 jQuery plugin to display your footnotes in lovely tooltips on hover. Plus it automatically numbers your footnotes in the order you enter them into your post.


#### Any plans for the future?


Yeah, I’ll be integrating more of qTip’s options for displaying the tooltips. Give users the ability to set their own icons and labels. And much more as I get user feedback.


#### That sounds great, but I was thinking more personally. You know, are you up to anything tonight? Want to grab some pizza?


How did you even get in here?


#### It’s cool I’ll let myself out. One last question though. Any advice on filling up a new plugins FAQ section?
